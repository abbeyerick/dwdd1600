        <p>Hi, my name is Abbey, and this is my little photography site. I got into film photography after feeling burnt out and uninspired with digital. I absolutely hated the need and expectation to edit my digital photos; I wanted to take photos as they are. That’s when I discovered film photography through social media creators. I bought my Canon AE-1 with my first paycheck, a bit on impulse, but it all worked out in the end.</p>

        <p>I’ve had a lot of trial and error learning film in a digital era. I love the ability to intentionally capture moments and the excitement of seeing how they turn out after development. I let the film and its grain add the editing — that’s where <em>Her Film Grain</em> comes in.</p>

        <h2>My Gear</h2>
        <h3>Cameras</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Canon AE-1</strong> - My first film camera, a manual 35 mm.</li>
            <li><strong>Pentax 17</strong> - My newest edition to my collection, a compact point-and-shoot. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/pentax-17-film-camera-review/" target="_blank">Read more about it.</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Film</h3>
        <p>The types of film I mainly use:</p>

            <li>Ilford Hp5 Plus 400 (B&W)</li>
        </ul>
