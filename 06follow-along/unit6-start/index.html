        <p>A delivery drone is an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle used to transport packages, medical supplies, food, or other goods.</p>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Drone delivery entered the mainstream in 2013 when major companies started exploring rapid delivery of lightweight products. Since then, technological advancements and regulatory approvals have paved the way for drone-based logistics.</p>
        <p>By 2016, FAA-approved drone deliveries were conducted in urban settings, and companies worldwide have since innovated to provide safe and efficient aerial delivery solutions.</p>
        <p>Today, we continue to push the boundaries of drone logistics to provide fast, reliable, and environmentally friendly delivery solutions.</p>
